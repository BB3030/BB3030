- 👋 Hi, I’m @BB3030
- 👀 I’m interested in motorbikes, heavy metal and beer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ML and AI via an Imperial College Business School 26 week course
- 💞️ I’m **not** looking to collaborate on anything here
- 📫 **don't** reach me - this account exists purely to meet code submission requirements as part of my studies
- 😄 Pronouns: him, he etc etc (git if you like)
- ⚡ Fun fact: *This is not the account you are looking for*
